        <h3>IPL 2k25 blog</h3>
        <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as Tata IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 cricket league held annually in India.[3] Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[4] It is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5] It is also India's most viewed sports competition followed by Pro Kabaddi League & Indian Super League as per BARC.[6][7]
In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[8] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[9][10] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][13][14] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[15] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[16] In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[17] Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers.[18]
In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[19] meaning each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[20] As of 2024, there have been seventeen seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after defeating the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[21]</p>
        
    
    <h3>kabadi blog</h3>
        <p>Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/,[2] /ˈkʌbədi/)[3] is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players. It is one of the traditional games of South Asia.[4] In this game, a raider enters the opposing half to tag defenders and return within 30 seconds while avoiding tackles. Points are awarded for successful tags, while defenders earn points for stopping the raider. Tagged or tackled players are temporarily out but can re-enter when their team scores. Raids alternate between teams throughout the game.

            It is popular in India, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the history of India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[5] It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket.[4][6] It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.[7]
            
            There are two major disciplines: "Punjabi kabaddi", also called "circle style", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, and the "standard style", on a rectangular court indoors, is played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.
            
            This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabaddi, komonti or ha-du-du in West Bengal and Bangladesh; baibalaa in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, ha-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu; and chakgudu in Sri Lanka.[8]</p>
    

        <h3>hocky blog</h3>
        <p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using sticks to propel a ball or disk into a goal.

            There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled or bladed, while others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by another word, as in field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey.
            
            In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a puck) with a hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant because it was designed in the 1990s and modelled on the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.
            
            Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally referred to as hockey include lacrosse, hurling, camogie, and shinty.</p>
